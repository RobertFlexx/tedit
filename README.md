# tedit — A Minimal Yet Mighty Command-Line Text Editor

`tedit` is a lightweight, command-line text editor designed to bring the power of traditional editors like *ed* and *ex* — but with modern touches, safety features, syntax highlighting, and theming, all in one fast and portable binary. (also check out https://github.com/Kokonico/medit !)

## Features

* **Fast, simple, and dependency-free** — written in pure C++17.
* **Modern safety:**

  * Atomic saves (`.tmp` → rename)
  * Optional automatic backups (`filename~`)
  * Undo/Redo stack (up to 200 operations)
* **Smart command-line interface** with autocompletion, command history, and tab suggestions.
* **Syntax highlighting** for multiple languages (C/C++, Python, Ruby, Shell, etc.).
* **Themes** for customizable aesthetics (`:theme neon`, `:theme retro`, etc.).
* **Confetti mode** for fun events such as successful saves.
* **Line numbering** toggle (`:set number on|off` or just `:number`).
* **Find/Replace** (`:find`, `:findre`, `:repl`, `:replg`).
* **Shell filters** — pipe code through any shell command:

  ```sh
  :filter 1-20 !sort
  ```
* **Directory tools** — built-in `:ls` and `:pwd`.
* **Cross-platform** (Linux, macOS, BSD; Windows via WSL).

* **Portable:** one small binary, no runtime bloat.
* **Accessible:** no cursor traps or redraw flickers.
